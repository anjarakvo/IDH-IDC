              This graph shows the gap between the household income levels and
              the income target for the current scenario. It also shows the gap
              between &apos;feasible&apos; household income and the income
              target, i.e. household income if all income drivers are set to
              their feasible levels. It also highlights variations within
              segments.
              <br />
              <br />
              Insights: Often income gaps can vary across different segments and
              hence each segment may need it&apos;s own custom strategy. One
              size may not fit all.

            <p>
              This graph helps users compare the contribution of each income
              driver on household income in two scenarios: In Scenario 1 (light
              green), we set an income driver to its feasible when all other
              drivers values remain at current level.
              <br />
              <br />
              Insights: First, comparing the contribution of each income driver
              to the household income in either the current or feasible
              scenario, can help idenitfy the most impactful drivers with
              regards to the impact they can have on household income. Second,
              it&apos;s important to note that the contributions of any driver
              are influenced by the values of other income drivers, so caution
              is advised when interpreting the impact of a single income driver
              in isolation.
              <br />
              <br />
              The value represented in the graph are a contribution (%) of the
              particular income driver to the household income for the
              particular scenario. The absolute value of the household income
              are different in the 2 scenrios.

              income changes resulting from changing an income driver from its
              current to its feasible level, and the final bar showcases the
              feasible total household income when all drivers are set to
              feasible values. We first change area from its current to its
              feasible level and see how income changes, next price, then yield
              etc.
